[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

This Python script extracts information about Bugcrowd programs, their targets, and reward ranges. It utilizes inferred Bugcrowd's API to fetch program data and generate a JSON file with the extracted information, without the need of scraping them by using any overloaded headless machinery.

## Features

- Program name extraction
- Program URL extraction
- Target group information extraction
- Reward range extraction (prices are in $)

## Configuration

- No additional configuration is required.

## Usage

```bash
python3 bugcrowd-spider.py
```

## Sample output
```json
{
    "programs": [
        {
            "name": "Rec Room Video Games",
